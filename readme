## Introduction

Welcome to StochiStats, a Python library tailored for astronomers and data enthusiasts. This toolkit, inspired by the adventurous spirit of Porco Rosso, is your compass to navigate the uncharted realms of stochastically sampled x-y data.

## Features

- **Flight-Tested**: StochiStats is as reliable as Porco's trusty seaplane, ready to handle your data, no matter how unpredictable it may be.

- **Sky-High Insights**: Unlock the hidden secrets of the universe with a wide range of functions designed for data exploration.

- **Clear Skies**: We've made StochiStats user-friendly, so you can focus on the skies, not the code.

## Installation

To get started, all you need is a bit of Python magic. Just install StochiStats with pip:

```bash
pip install StochiStats

Usage

Let's take this baby for a spin! Here's a quick code snippet to kickstart your data exploration:

python

import StochiStats as ss

# Load your stochastically sampled x-y data
data = ss.load_data("your_data.csv")

# Unlock the mysteries
statistics = ss.generate_statistics(data)

# Chart your course
ss.plot_data(data)

Join the Crew

If you feel the call of adventure and the thrill of scientific discovery, join us aboard the StochiStats crew. Together, we'll chart the skies and venture into the unknown.
